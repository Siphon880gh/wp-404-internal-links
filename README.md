## ‚ùì FAQ

### How does the link scanning work?
The plugin crawls through your WordPress site's content (pages, posts, and other content types) to identify all internal links. It then tests each link to determine if it returns a 404 error or other issues. The scanning process runs in the background and provides real-time progress updates.

### Will this plugin slow down my website?
No. The scanning process only runs when you manually initiate it from the admin dashboard. It doesn't affect your site's frontend performance or loading speed for visitors.

### Can I schedule automatic scans?
Currently, scans must be initiated manually. Automatic scheduling features are planned for a future update and will be available in the plugin settings.

### What types of links are checked?
The plugin focuses on internal links within your WordPress site. It can optionally check external links as well, but the primary focus is on identifying broken internal navigation that affects SEO and user experience.

### How do I fix broken links found by the plugin?
The plugin provides several options for each broken link: replace the link with a correct URL, remove the link entirely, or mark it to be ignored. The fix functionality is currently being enhanced for the next version.
